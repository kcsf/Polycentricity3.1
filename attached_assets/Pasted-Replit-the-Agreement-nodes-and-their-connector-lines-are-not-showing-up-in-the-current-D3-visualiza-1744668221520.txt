Replit, the Agreement nodes and their connector lines are not showing up in the current D3 visualization in D3CardBoard.svelte. Unlike the React version where Actors had direct edges to Agreements, we now need to traverse the graph to map actors -> agreements to cards -> agreements for visualization. Hereâ€™s how to fix this, ensuring the visual elements match the React reference:

Verify Agreement Data in loadGameData:
Ensure agreements array is correctly populated by traversing the graph:
From nodes.games/<game_id>/players, map user_id to actor_id.
For each Actor, get their card_id and store in actorCardMap.
Fetch Agreements linked to each Actor (actors/<actor_id>/agreements -> agreements/<agreement_id>).
Ensure each Agreement has a position and is added to the agreements array with obligations and benefits mapped to actor_ids.
Render Agreement Nodes in initializeGraph:
Confirm Agreement nodes are added to the nodes array with type: "agreement".
In the visualization, ensure Agreement nodes are rendered as small circles (radius 17, from --agreement-node-radius), with fill: #444444 and white text (fill: #FFFFFF, bold, centered, e.g., "AG1", "AG2").
Render Connector Lines Between Cards and Agreements:
In initializeGraph, ensure links array maps Agreements to Cards using actorCardMap:
For each agreement.obligations, map fromActorId to cardId (source: cardId, target: agreement.agreement_id).
For each agreement.benefits, map toActorId to cardId (source: agreement.agreement_id, target: cardId).
Render connector lines as thin light gray lines (stroke: #e5e5e5, stroke-width: 1) with arrow markers (marker-end: url(#arrow-marker)).
Position Agreement Nodes at Midpoints:
In updateLinks, ensure Agreement nodes are positioned at the midpoint between their connected Cards (using partyCardIds), updating their x and y coordinates smoothly.
Ensure the visualization matches the React reference: Agreement nodes as dark gray circles with white text, and connector lines as thin light gray lines with arrows, positioned correctly between Cards and Agreements. Handle errors and provide a smooth user experience with confirmation messages if needed.
