**Task Reminder**: We are writing Excellent code using Best Practices for Svelte 5.28.1 in RUNES mode, with primary packages: `"@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.3"`, `"gun": "^0.2020.1240"`, `"d3": "^7.9.0"`, `"@skeletonlabs/skeleton": "^3.1.2"`. Always use optimized functions from `src/lib/services/gameService.ts` for Gun.js interactions, avoiding direct or duplicate `gun.db` calls. Check all files for TypeScript errors before saving. Do not use temporary or hardcoded fallback values (e.g., remove `augmentCardValues` and similar logic that substitutes database values with hardcoded arrays like `['Sustainability', 'Ecological Thinking', 'Self Reliance']`).

Thank you for stabilizing `+page.svelte` and optimizing `D3CardBoard.svelte`. However, a 3-second timeout in `loadUserActor`, excessive `localStorage` logging, and failure to retrieve card values from the database remain. This task focuses on fixing the timeout and logging issues in `loadUserActor`. Complete this step, test thoroughly, and confirm the issue is resolved before stopping.

### Step 1: Remove Timeout and Optimize Logging in loadUserActor
- Open `src/routes/games/[gameId]/+page.svelte`.
- In `loadUserActor`, remove any remaining timeout logic (e.g., `setTimeout` or `Promise.race` with a 3-second limit) to prevent the `[GamePage] User actor loading timed out after 3 seconds` error.
- Ensure `loadUserActor` relies solely on cached data from `game.player_actor_map` and `actorCache` (from `gameService.ts`) without asynchronous Gun.js calls or direct `gun.get()` calls.
- Debounce `localStorage` checks to log `[GamePage] Found saved actor ID in localStorage: ...` only once per execution (e.g., check `localStorage` once at the start and store the result in a variable).
- Update logging to be concise and clear (e.g., `[GamePage] Actor lookup for user ${userId}: ${actor ? actor.actor_id : 'none'}`).
- Check for TypeScript errors using `svelte-check` or your IDE, ensuring all types (e.g., `Game`, `Actor`) are correctly defined and imported from `src/lib/types/index.ts`.
- Test by loading a game page, confirming:
  - No timeout errors (e.g., `[GamePage] User actor loading timed out`).
  - Only one `localStorage` log per load (e.g., `[GamePage] Found saved actor ID in localStorage: ...`).
  - Correct actor retrieval from cache (e.g., `[GamePage] Actor lookup for user ${userId}: m9oak1e2uwj56xir]`).
  - No TypeScript errors in the console or build output.
- Log any errors encountered during testing and pause for further instructions if the step fails.

**Important Notes**:
- Do not introduce temporary or hardcoded fallback values in this or any function.
- Remove any logic resembling `augmentCardValues` (e.g., in `D3CardBoard.svelte` or related files) that substitutes missing database values with hardcoded arrays (e.g., `['Sustainability', 'Ecological Thinking', 'Self Reliance']`). If found, delete such logic and rely solely on database-fetched values.
- Use only optimized `gameService.ts` functions (e.g., `getGame`, `getGameActors`, `actorCache`) for data access.
- After completing this step, save the file, test the game page, and confirm resolution in the console logs. Do not proceed to additional tasks until this step is fully verified.
